= Spring Boot - OAuth2 m2m Hands-on
:toc:

== Introduction

=== What's this?

Baking the OAuth2 machine-to-machine (m2m) flow into a Spring Boot application (client credentials grant) to access a protected resource can be realized in several ways - options like Spring Security, Spring Security OAuth2 Client, Web Flux, etc. may or may not fit regarding their potential for overhead.

This hands-on project comes with a minimalistic approach to demonstrate how to implement the OAuth2 m2m flow in a Spring Boot agnostic way.
